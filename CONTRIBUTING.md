## 🎯 How to Contribute

### 1️⃣ Find an Issue
- Look for issues labeled **`AMSOC-ACCEPTED`**
- Only these issues are eligible for WoC points
- Comment: *“I’d like to work on this issue”* before starting

---

### 2️⃣ Set Up the Project
- Follow setup instructions in **README.md**
- Ensure resume upload and analysis work locally before coding

---

### 3️⃣ Work on the Issue
- Create a new branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b woc/issue-short-description
  ```
- Keep changes focused on the assigned issue
- Test thoroughly (especially /analyze_resume/)

### 4️⃣ Submit a Pull Request
  - PR Title Format
    ```text
    [WoC] Short and clear description
    ```
  - PR Description Must Include
  - Issue reference (e.g., `Closes #123`)
  - Summary of changes
  - Testing details (resume upload tested: Yes/No)
  - Screenshots (if UI related)

### ✅ Rules & Best Practices
  - AI tools are allowed, but:
      - Code must follow project style
      - No copied code without attribution
      - You must understand and explain your changes

  - Follow clean commit messages:
      - `feat: add resume validation`
      - `fix: handle empty PDF`
  - One issue → one PR
  - Spam, low-effort, or plagiarized PRs may result in penalties

### ⚡ Review Process
  - Maintainers review PRs within 24–48 hours
  - Changes may be requested
  - Once approved → merged → points awarded based on issue difficulty
